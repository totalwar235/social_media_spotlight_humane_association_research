# Effects of Social Media Spotlights on Humane Association Data in Northwest Wisconsin
Abstract
Humane Associations take in unwanted animals, either from owners that can no longer care for them or strays that were captured by various government bodies. These animals will stay in the shelter until adopted, or the shelter deems it more humane to euthanize the animal. The rise in use of social media opened avenues of outreach for the Humane Associations that can affect adoption rates. Previous studies show the rise in social media usage by Humane Associations, especially on Facebook and Twitter, to advertise their work and the animals in the shelter. The research connects 6,000 animals that have gone through various shelters in Northwest Wisconsin and determine what effect 15,000 Facebook posts had on their adoption. Where an animal has a social media spotlight post, on average they will be adopted 8 days earlier than if there was no social media spotlight.
